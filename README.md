## Overview

This session introduces attendees to SAP Automation Pilot and SAP Cloud ALM in the context of Day 2 Operations. The main  goal is for participants to gain practical experience in automating different set of technical operation tasks in SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP). To do so, is needed to set up an integration between SAP Automation Pilot and SAP Cloud ALM. During this hands-on we will explore how to trigger ready-to-use commands in SAP Automation Pilot to do troubleshooting and perform remediation actions based on alerts in SAP Cloud ALM. You will also learn how to build your own automation flows or extend existing ones.

## Products in focus 
### SAP Automation Pilot 
The goal of SAP Automation Pilot is to simplify and automate complex manual technical processes and flows. This enables DevOps teams to run their solutions on SAP BTP with minimal operational effort.

#### SAP Automation Pilot is a low-code / no-code automation engine that allows you to:
- Automate sequences of steps,
- Execute scripts in a serverless manner,
- Use catalogs of commands provided by SAP to automate typical Ops tasks in and outside your SAP BTP landscape,
- Build custom automations.
 
Automations in SAP Automation Pilot can be triggered in various ways to best fit your operational needs - manually by the DevOps team, through the built-in scheduler, automatically via integration with services and ops platforms like SAP Cloud ALM, or by other applications and systems.

The service is designed to work with low latency, even under a heavy workload, and is capable of triggering hundreds of automations simultaneously.

### SAP Cloud ALM for Operations

**SAP Cloud ALM **is SAP’s cloud-based application lifecycle management solution designed to support the implementation and operation of SAP cloud and hybrid landscapes. It provides end-to-end transparency across business processes, integrations, and system health. 

**Cloud ALM for Operations** focuses on ensuring business continuity by monitoring the availability, performance, and exceptions of cloud and on-premise solutions. It enables IT and operations teams to proactively detect and resolve issues through automated alerts, analytics, and intelligent insights. Together, they help organizations achieve efficient, reliable, and compliant operations across your SAP environment.
